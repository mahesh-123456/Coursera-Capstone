This defines the scope of thisproject which is confined to the city of Hyderabad, the capital ofTelangana. • Latitude and longitude coordinates of theseneighbourhoods. This is required in order to plot the map andalso to get the venue data. • Venue data, particularly data relatedto shopping malls. We will use this data to perform clustering onthe neighbourhoods"
